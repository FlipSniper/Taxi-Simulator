Theme Signal:

Customers when picked up give a signal

Theres a signal dictionary if your not sure what it means

I didn't get to do much as I kept getting bugs

I got inspired by traffic signals but didn't even get time to add that to my game.

I have no idea how I didn't get time.

Well lots of bugs. First you either get infinite or 0 cash when dropping a customer off.

A minimap shows locations of anything you need to know

RED = DESTINATION

BLUE = YOU

GREEN = CUSTOMER

I used Godot to make it and it's my first time using vehicle body3D

it may get really laggy but I'll fix it next update its because of physics proccess + 1000 collisions its mainly because of how poorly the map was made it had 2k meshes.

I decided to make this as I've been longing to make a taxi simulator but did not have enough motivation.
